# Code Challenge

**Given:** An array of points on a 2D plane,

**Find:** The maximum number of points that are visible from point (0, 0) with a viewing angle that is equal to 45 degrees.

---

## Example

For:

```
points = [[1, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3],
          [1, 3], [2, 5], [1, 5], [-1, -1],
          [-1, -2], [-2, -3], [-4, -4]]
```
The output should be solution(points) = 6.
