# Task Description

Given two strings `a` and `b`, both consisting only of lowercase English letters, the task is to calculate how many strings equal to `a` can be constructed using only letters from the string `b`. Note: Each letter can be used only once and in one string only.

### Example

- For `a = "abc"` and `b = "abccba"`, the output should be `solution(a, b) = 2`.

We can construct 2 strings `a = "abc"` using only letters from the string `b`.

- For `a = "ab"` and `b = "abcbcb"`, the output should be `solution(a, b) = 1`.
