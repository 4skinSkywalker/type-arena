**Challenge Description**

Given a 2D grid `skyMap` composed of '1's (clouds) and '0's (clear sky), count the number of clouds. A cloud is surrounded by clear sky, and is formed by connecting adjacent clouds horizontally or vertically. You can assume that all four edges of the `skyMap` are surrounded by clear sky.

**Example**

For:

```
skyMap = [['0', '1', '1', '0', '1'],
          ['0', '1', '1', '1', '1'],
          ['0', '0', '0', '0', '1'],
          ['1', '0', '0', '1', '1']]
```

The output should be:

```
solution(skyMap) = 2
```

For:

```
skyMap = [['0', '1', '0', '0', '1'],
          ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
          ['0', '0', '1', '0', '1'],
          ['0', '0', '1', '1', '0'],
          ['1', '0', '1', '1', '0']]
```

The output should be:

```
solution(skyMap) = 5
```
