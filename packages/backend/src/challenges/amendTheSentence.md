## Challenge Description

You have been given a string `s`, which is supposed to be a sentence. However, someone forgot to put spaces between the different words, and for some reason they capitalized the first letter of every word. 

You need to return the sentence after making the following amendments:

- Put a single space between the words.
- Convert the uppercase letters to lowercase.

### Example

For `s = "CodesignalIsAwesome"`, the output should be
`solution(s) = "codesignal is awesome";`

For `s = "Hello"`, the output should be
`solution(s) = "hello".`
