## Challenge Description

You are given an array of integers. Sort its sub-array between the given indices `l` and `r` (inclusive) and leave the other elements intact.

#### Example
For `a = [5, 2, 1, 7, 5, 3, 2, 3]`, `l = 0`, and `r = 3`, the output should be
`solution(a, l, r) = [1, 2, 5, 7, 5, 3, 2, 3]`.
