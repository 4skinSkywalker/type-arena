**Task**

Given a singly linked list of integers, the task is to determine whether or not it's a palindrome.

Note: in examples below and tests preview linked lists are presented as arrays just for simplicity of visualization: in real data you will be given a head node l of the linked list

**Example**

For l = [0, 1, 0], the output should be `solution(l) = true;`

For l = [1, 2, 2, 3], the output should be `solution(l) = false.`
