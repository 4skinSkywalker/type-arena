# Challenge Description

Given a position of a knight on the standard chessboard, find the number of different moves the knight can perform.

The knight can move to a square that is two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally away from it. The complete move therefore looks like the letter L.

## Example:

For cell = "a1", the output should be `solution(cell) = 2`.

For cell = "c2", the output should be `solution(cell) = 6`.
