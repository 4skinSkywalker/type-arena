# Code Challenge Description

A rectangle with sides equal to even integers `a` and `b` is drawn on the Cartesian plane. Its center (the intersection point of its diagonals) coincides with the point (0, 0), but the sides of the rectangle are not parallel to the axes; instead, they are forming 45 degree angles with the axes.

Your task is to find out how many points with integer coordinates are located inside of this given rectangle (including on its sides).

## Example

For `a = 6` and `b = 4`, the output should be `solution(a, b) = 23`.
