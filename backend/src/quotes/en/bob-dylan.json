The thought that he was writing literature couldn't have entered his head. His words were written for the stage. Meant to be spoken not read. When he was writing Hamlet, I'm sure he was thinking about a lot of different things: \"Who're the right actors for these roles?\" \"How should this be staged?\" \"Do I really want to set this in Denmark?\" His creative vision and ambitions were no doubt at the forefront of his mind, but there were also more mundane matters to consider and deal with. \"Is the financing in place?\" \"Are there enough good seats for my patrons?\" \"Where am I going to get a human skull?\" I would bet that the farthest thing from Shakespeare's mind was the question \"Is this literature?\""
