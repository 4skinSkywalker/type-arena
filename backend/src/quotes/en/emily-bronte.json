    [
      "I am the only being whose doom no tongue would ask, no eye would mourn. I never caused a thought of gloom, a smile of joy since I was born. In secret pleasure - secret tears, this changeful life has slipped away. As friendless after eighteen years, as lone as on my natal day."
    ],
    [
      "First melted off the hope of youth. Then Fancy's rainbow fast withdrew, and then experience told me truth in mortal bosoms never grew. 'Twas grief enough to think mankind all hollow, servile, insincere, but worse to trust my own mind and find the same corruption there."

      "I cannot live without my soul; I cannot live without my life!"

      "The night is darkening round me. The wild winds coldly blow; but a tyrant spell has bound me, and I cannot, cannot go. The giant trees are bending, their bare boughs weighed with snow, and the storm is fast descending, and yet I cannot go. Clouds beyond clouds above me, wastes beyond wastes below; but nothing drear can move me - I will not, cannot go."
    ],
    [
      "Shall Earth no more inspire thee, thou lonely dreamer now? Since passion may not fire thee, shall Nature cease to bow? Thy mind is ever moving in regions dark to thee; recall its useless roving - come back and dwell with me"
    ],
    [
      "I've watched thee every hour - I know my mighty sway - I know my magic power to drive thy griefs away"

      "He comes with western winds, with evening's wandering airs, with that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars; winds take a pensive tone and stars a tender fire, and visions rise and change, which kills me with desire."

    [
      "But first a hush of peace, a soundless calm descends; the struggle of distress and fierce impatience ends. Mute music soothes my breast - unuttered harmony that I could never dream till earth was lost to me. Then dawns the Invisible; the Unseen its truth reveals. My outward sense is gone, my inward essence feels - its wings are almost free, it is home, its harbor found. Measuring the gulf, it stoops and dares the final bound - O, dreadful is the check - intense the agony when the ear begins to hear and the eye begins to see; when the pulse begins to throb, the brain to think again, the soul to feel the flesh and the flesh to feel the chain. Yet I would lose no sting, would wish no torture less; the more that anguish racks, the earlier it will bless. And robed in fires of Hell, or bright with heavenly shine, if it but herald Death, the vision is divine"

    [
      "When weary with the long day's care, and earthly change from pain to pain, and lost and ready to despair, thy kind voice calls me back again: Oh, my true friend! I am not lone, while thou canst speak with such a tone!"

    [
      "Cold in the earth - and the deep snow piled above thee, far, far, removed, cold in the dreary grave! Have I forgot, my only Love, to love thee, severed at last by Time's all-severing wave?"
    ],
    [
      "Sweet Love of youth, forgive, if I forget thee, while the world's tide is bearing me along; other desires and other hopes beset me, hopes which obscure, but cannot do thee wrong!"
    ],
    [
      "But when the days of golden dreams had perished, and even Despair was powerless to destroy; then did I learn how existence could be cherished, strengthened, and fed without the aid of joy."

      "No coward soul is mine, no trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere: I see Heaven's glories shine, and Faith shines equal, arming me from Fear. O God within my breast, Almighty, ever-present Deity! Life - that in me has rest, as I - undying Life - have power in Thee! Vain are the thousand creeds that move men's hearts: unutterably vain; worthless as withered weeds, or idlest froth amid the boundless main..."

Though earth and moon were gone, and suns and universes ceased to be, and Thou wert left alone, every existence would exist in Thee. There is not room for Death, nor atom that his might could render void: Thou - Thou art Being and Breath, and what Thou art may never be destroyed."
