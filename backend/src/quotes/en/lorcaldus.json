    "bio": "Lorcaldus is an Italian programmer with one primary goal: do as little as possible. Despite his best efforts he repeatedly found himself embroiled in a cascade of useless projects, where his workload mysteriously multiplied like he owed money to the mob boss. Ironically, the less he wanted to work, the more he seemed to contribute to the absurd software history. A true testament to his talent for doing everything except nothing!",
