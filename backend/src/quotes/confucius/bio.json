    "bio": "Confucius (traditionally 28 September 551 B.C. – 479 B.C.) was a Chinese social philosopher, whose teachings deeply influenced East Asian life and thought. \"Confucius\" is a latinization of the Chinese 孔夫子, Kong Fu Zi or K'ung-fu-tzu, literally \"Master Kong\", but he is usually referred to in China with a simpler version of this honorific as 孔子, Kongzi, or Kǒng Zǐ."
