## Sudoku Puzzle Checker

Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Your task is to implement a function that checks if the given grid of numbers represents a correct solution to Sudoku.

**For example:**

Consider the grid  

    grid = [
            [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 9, 8, 7],
            [4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 1],
            [7, 9, 8, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 4],
            [9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 7, 6],
            [3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1, 9],
            [6, 8, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, 4, 3],
            [5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 3, 2],
            [2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8],
            [8, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]
          ]
the output should be

    solution(grid) = true;

Alternatively:

For grid 

    grid = [
            [1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7],
            [4, 6, 8, 5, 7, 9, 3, 2, 1],
            [7, 9, 2, 8, 1, 3, 6, 5, 4],
            [9, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 8, 7, 6],
            [3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8, 2, 1, 9],
            [6, 8, 1, 7, 9, 2, 5, 4, 3],
            [5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 3, 2],
            [2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 1, 9, 8],
            [8, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]
           ]
the output should be

    solution(grid) = false.

The output should be false: each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids should contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
