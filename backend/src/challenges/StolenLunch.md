# Decipher a Note

You recently visited your little nephew. He told you a story about a bully at his school who steals his lunch every day. The bully locks the lunch away in his locker and leaves a note with a coded message. You were able to decipher this message. It appears that all the digits in the note are replaced with letters and vice versa. Specifically, digit 0 is replaced with 'a', 1 is replaced with 'b' etc., up to digit 9 which is replaced by 'j'.

- The note is different every day. 

You decide to write a function that will decipher these notes for your nephew on an ongoing basis.

## Example

```
For note = "you'll n4v4r 6u4ss 8t: cdja", the output should be
solution(note) = "you'll never guess it: 2390".
```
