# Strongly Connected Directed Graph Challenge

## Task:

You are given a strongly connected directed graph that has positive weights in the adjacency matrix `g`. The graph is represented as a square matrix, where `g[i][j]` is the weight of the edge `(i, j)`, or `-1` if there is no such edge.

Your task is, given `g` and the index of a start vertex `s`, to find the minimal distances between the start vertex `s` and each of the vertices of the graph.

## Example

For

```
g = [[-1, 3, 2],
     [2, -1, 0],
     [-1, 0, -1]]
```
and `s = 0`, the output should be
```
solution(g, s) = [0, 2, 2]
```

Reasoning:

- The distance from the start vertex `0` to itself is `0`.
- The distance from the start vertex `0` to vertex `1` is `2 + 0 = 2`.
- The distance from the start vertex `0` to vertex `2` is `2`.

Example usage:

```
g = [[-1, 3, 2],
     [2, -1, 0],
     [-1, 0, -1]]
s = 0
print(solution(g, s)) # Output: [0, 2, 2]
```
