## Challenge Description

You are supposed to label a bunch of boxes with numbers from 0 to n inclusive, and all the labels are stored in the array `arr`. Unfortunately one of the labels is missing. Your task is to find it.

**Example**

For `arr = [3, 1, 0]`, the output should be `solution(arr) = 2`.

For `arr = [0]`, the output should be `solution(arr) = 1`.

**Explanation:**
Boxes should be labeled from 0 to 1 inclusive, so in this case the missing label is 1.
