**Challenge**

You are trying to figure out the initial setup of a volleyball game where you missed the start. The team is arranged as follows:

```
0 3 0
4 0 2
0 6 0
5 0 1
```
Positive numbers here denote player positions. When the team gets a chance for serving, they rotate their positions in a clockwise way. As a result, a player from position 2 moves to position 1, from position 3 to position 2, etc., with the player at position 1 moving to position 6.

After being given the current formation of the team and the number of serves (k), your task is to find each player's original position.

**Example**

1. If the formation is as follows:

```
formation = [
  ["empty",   "Player5", "empty"],
  ["Player4", "empty",   "Player2"],
  ["empty",   "Player3", "empty"],
  ["Player6", "empty",   "Player1"]
]
```
and `k = 2`, the result should be:
```
[
  ["empty",   "Player1", "empty"],
  ["Player2", "empty",   "Player3"],
  ["empty",   "Player4", "empty"],
  ["Player5", "empty",   "Player6"]
]
```
2. If the formation is as follows:

```
formation = [
  ["empty", "Alice", "empty"],
  ["Bob",   "empty", "Charlie"],
  ["empty", "Dave",  "empty"],
  ["Eve",   "empty", "Frank"]
]
```
and `k = 6`, the result should be:

```
[
  ["empty", "Alice", "empty"],
  ["Bob",   "empty", "Charlie"],
  ["empty", "Dave",  "empty"],
  ["Eve",   "empty", "Frank"]
]
```
