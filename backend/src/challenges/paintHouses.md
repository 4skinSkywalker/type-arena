## Challenge

In San Francisco, there is a row of several beautiful houses called the Painted Ladies. Each of the Painted Ladies can be painted with one of three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. cost[i][0] for each i is the cost of painting house i red, cost[i][1] is the cost of painting it blue, and cost[i][2] is the cost of painting it green.

You want to paint all the houses in a way such that no two adjacent Painted Ladies have the same color. Find the minimum cost to achieve this.

### Example

For cost = [[1, 3, 4], [2, 3, 3], [3, 1, 4]], the output should be solution(cost) = 5.

You can paint the first Painted Lady red for a cost of 1, the second one green for a cost of 3, and the third one blue for a cost of 1, for a total cost of 5.
