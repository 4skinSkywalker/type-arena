## Challenge Description

Given a list of integers `l` and an integer `k`, the challenge is to remove all elements from list `l` that have a value equal to `k`.

### Examples:
- For `l = [3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, the output should be `solution(l, k) = [1, 2, 4, 5]`.
- For `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `k = 10`, the output should be `solution(l, k) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
